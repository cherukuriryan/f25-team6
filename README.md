## Description 
> Our application is a tutoring service called SpartanPro. This application exists so students may be able to acquire tutoring sessions for classes that may not have tutoring offered by the school. Our application also allows students to work around the tutors flexible hours compared to strict school tutoring hours. SpartanPro will be a useful tool for students who simply want 1 0n 1 tutoring, compared to group sessions schools usually offer.


## App Functions
Customer (the user with the customer role):

1. Create/modify customer profile:
      The customer shall be able to click their profile button, where their info will be displayed with an edit button to make changes. (email, password and subjects)

2. View available services:
     To view tutors for a certain subject, the customer will need to click on the profile button and under their profile info there will be a long list of subjects where the customer can click a + button to turn it into a check. A checked subject means when the customer returns to the homescreen, those specific subjects tutors will be listed.

3. Subscribe to available services:
     Alongside being able to subscribe to the subjects to show available tutors, the customer will also be able to click on a tutor's profile from the homescreen to book a tutoring time.

4. Write reviews for subscribed services:
     Only after a completed tutoring session will a customer be able to write a review for a tutor. The customer will be able to click on their previous tutor's profile, where they will be able to find a "leave a review" button. This will eliminate the chance of false reviews.
