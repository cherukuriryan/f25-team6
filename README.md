## Description
> SpartanPro helps students connect with peer tutors across a wide range of classes. Students can schedule sessions at times that fit their schedules, making tutoring flexible and accessible. By matching students with fellow Spartans who are comfortable with the material, SpartanPro creates a supportive community where everyone can succeed. We are building this app to make sure no student has to struggle alone, especially in challenging courses where tutoring is scarce.
